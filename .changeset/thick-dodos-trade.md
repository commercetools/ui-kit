Introduce a new component `<InlineSvg>` to render SVG documents dynamically. The component is exported as a separate entrypoint.

```js
import InlineSvg from '@commercetools-uikit/icons/inline-svg';
```

> This component is meant to be used internally within other packages and it's not recommended to use it directly, unless there are valid reasons.
