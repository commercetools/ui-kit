We've introduced a new property (**showAfter**) in the `Tooltip` component that allows you to control the delay before the tooltip is shown. Its default value is 0.3 seconds.

Also, we've modified the default value for the **closeAfter** property to 0.2 seconds (previous value was 0).

Finally, we added a `grow` effect to the tooltip when it is shown and hidden.
