'@commercetools-uikit/secondary-button': patch
'@commercetools-uikit/design-system': patch
---

A new property called **tone** has been added to the component so consumers can use it with different color schemes (**secondary** and **info** by now).
Also, the **theme** property has been deprecated and it will be removed in the future, so please don't use it anymore (use the new one instead if needed).
