# ViewSwitcher

## Description

The `<ViewSwitcher>` component allow users to toggle between two or more different views of the same, similar or related content items within the same space on screen.

## When to use

Let users toggle between different formatting's, like with a grid view and a table view.

## When not to use

**Do not use the `<ViewSwitcher>` as tabs.**
Tabs should be used when the content on the page is divided into related sections but without any overlap.

**Do not use the `<ViewSwitcher>` as toggle.**
Toggles are used for "yes/no" or "on/off" binary decisions.

## Do's and Don'ts

- If you use an icon within the `<ViewSwitcher>`, each switch needs to have an icon.
- No colored icons are allowed. Only `--color-solid` (black).
- Do not use two lines of text in one switch field.

## Installation

```
yarn add @commercetools-uikit/view-switcher
```

```
npm --save install @commercetools-uikit/view-switcher
```

Additionally install the peer dependencies (if not present)

```
yarn add react
```

```
npm --save install react
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import ViewSwitcher from '@commercetools-uikit/view-switcher';

/**
 * 1. Uncontrolled mode
 *
 * The component controls its own internal state and switching between options.
 * The `defaultSelected` value is only used on the initial render. Changes to that value
 * are not reflected in the component state.
 */
const UncontrolledExample = () => (
  <ViewSwitcher.Group
    defaultSelected="button 2"
    onChange={(value) => console.log(value)}
  >
    <ViewSwitcher.Button isDisabled value="button 1">
      View 1
    </ViewSwitcher.Button>
    <ViewSwitcher.Button value="button 2">View 2</ViewSwitcher.Button>
    <ViewSwitcher.Button value="button 3">View 3</ViewSwitcher.Button>
  </ViewSwitcher.Group>
);

/**
 * 2. Controlled mode
 *
 * The component is controlled from a parent component, using the prop `selectedValue`.
 * The component does not use an internal state and the parent must implement the `onChange` callback.
 */
const ControlledExample = () => {
  const [seletedValue, setSelectedValue] = useState('button 1');

  return (
    <ViewSwitcher.Group
      selectedValue={seletedValue}
      onChange={setSelectedValue}
    >
      <ViewSwitcher.Button isDisabled value="button 1">
        View 1
      </ViewSwitcher.Button>
      <ViewSwitcher.Button value="button 2">View 2</ViewSwitcher.Button>
      <ViewSwitcher.Button value="button 3">View 3</ViewSwitcher.Button>
    </ViewSwitcher.Group>
  );
};

export { UncontrolledExample, ControlledExample };
```
