The `<ViewSwitcher>` component allow users to toggle between two or more different views of the same, similar or related content items within the same space on screen.

## When to use

Let users toggle between different formatting's, like with a grid view and a table view.

## When not to use

**Do not use the `<ViewSwitcher>` as tabs.**
Tabs should be used when the content on the page is divided into related sections but without any overlap.

**Do not use the `<ViewSwitcher>` as toggle.**
Toggles are used for "yes/no" or "on/off" binary decisions.

## Do's and Don'ts

- If you use an icon within the `<ViewSwitcher>`, each switch needs to have an icon.
- No colored icons are allowed. Only `--color-solid` (black).
- Do not use two lines of text in one switch field.
