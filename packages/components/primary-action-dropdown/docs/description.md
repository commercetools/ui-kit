A `PrimaryActionDropdown` is a dropdown with any number of action whereas the first action of the dropdown can be triggered without opening the dropdown
itself.

The primary action, rendered as the head of the dropdown, is always the first non-disabled `<Option />`. If all `<Option />`s are disabled, the head of the
dropdown will be disabled.
