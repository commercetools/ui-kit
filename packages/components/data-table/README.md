# DataTable

## Description

Shows tabular data, defined by a list of items: the `rows`, and another list with their corresponding definitions: the `columns`. Both these lists are arrays of objects.

- The `rows` list defines the items you want to render, where each item only requires a unique `id` which is used for mapping, and the remaining properties to be shown under each column.
- On the `columns` list, each object requires a unique `key` which should correspond to property key of the items of `rows` that you want to render under this column, and a `label` which defines the name shown on the header of the column.

These are the only requirements for rendering the most simple table which should suffice for most use cases and is scaled automatically for the available space.

For more advanced configuration and layout customization, a plethora of other options are available, including <i>per-column</i> specific options.

For adding a Row Selection behavior, check the `useRowSelection` hook which you can use to prepare your `rows` and `columns` before passing them to the DataTable component.

You can use this value to determine which value from a row item should be rendered.<br> For example, if the data is a list of users, where each user has a `firstName` property, the column key should be `firstName`, which renders the correct value by default. The key can also be some custom or computed value, in which case you need to provide an explicit mapping of the value by implementing either the `itemRendered` function or the column-specific `renderItem` function.                                                   |

By default, the column grows according to the content and respecting the total table available width.                                                                                                                                                      |

It is advised to place these types of components through this prop instead of `label`, in order to properly position and align the elements. This is particularly useful for medium-sized icons which require more vertical space than the typography.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

By enforcing a minimum width for these columns, the table will respect them and grow horizontally, adding scrollbars if needed. |

You should enable this flag for every column you want to be able to sort. When at least one column is sortable, the table props `sortBy`, `sortDirection` and `onSortChange` should be provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
