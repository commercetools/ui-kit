# DataTable

## Description

Shows tabular data, defined by a list of items: the `rows`, and another list with their corresponding definitions: the `columns`. Both these lists are arrays of objects.

- The `rows` list defines the items you want to render, where each item only requires a unique `id` which is used for mapping, and the remaining properties to be shown under each column.
- On the `columns` list, each object requires a unique `key` which should correspond to property key of the items of `rows` that you want to render under this column, and a `label` which defines the name shown on the header of the column.

These are the only requirements for rendering the most simple table which should suffice for most use cases and is scaled automatically for the available space.

For more advanced configuration and layout customization, a plethora of other options are available, including <i>per-column</i> specific options.

For adding a Row Selection behaviour, check the `useRowSelection` hook which you can use to prepare your `rows` and `columns` before passing them to the DataTable component.

## Usage

```jsx
import { DataTable } from '@commercetools-uikit/data-table';

const rows = [
  { id: 'parasite', title: 'Parasite', country: 'South Korea' },
  { id: 'portrait', title: 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire', country: 'France' },
  { id: 'wat', title: 'Woman at War', country: 'Iceland' },
];

const columns = [
  { key: 'title', label: 'Title' },
  { key: 'country', label: 'Country' },
];

return <DataTable rows={rows} columns={columns} />;
```

| `disableHeaderStickiness` | `bool`               | -        | `false`                              | Enable this flag to disable the sticky behaviour of the header.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `disableSelfContainment`  | `bool`               | -        | `false`                              | Enabling this flag allows taking control of the containment of the table and doing it on a parent element. This means that the table will grow in size without adding scrollbars on itself, both vertically and horizontally -- and as a consequence, the `maxHeight` and `maxWidth` props are ignored, so if you need to enforce these constraints, you must also apply them on the parent element. Additionally, the sticky behaviour of the header will get fixed relatively to the closest parent element with `position: relative`. |
| `onColumnResized`         | `func`               | -        |                                      | Callback function which is called when a column has been resized with the mouse and which receives an array of the column widths after the resizing. One can use this callback to get the resized column widths and persist them, to be used as values for the column widths when a user comes back to the same view, finding the table in the same state as before.                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Columns

> An array of objects describing the table's column definitions and options for each of them.

| Props                  | Type      | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`                  | `string`  | ✅       | -       | The unique key of the column that is used to identify your data type. Each key should correspond to the fields of the items you want to display as data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `label`                | `string`  | ✅       | -       | The label of the column that will be shown on the column header.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `align`                | `string`  | -        | -       | Use this to override the table's own `horizontalCellAlignment` prop for this specific column. Can be one of [`left`, `center`, `right`].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `width`                | `string`  | -        | `auto`  | Sets a `width` for this column. Accepts the same values as the ones specified for individual [grid-template-columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns). Some common useful examples are `minmax` pairs (e.g. `minmax(200px, 400px)`), combinations of fraction values (`1fr`/`2fr`/etc), or fixed values such as `200px`. By default, the column grows according to the content and respecting the total table available width. |
| `renderItem`           | `func`    | -        | -       | Callback function to render the content of cells under this column, overriding the default `itemRenderer` prop of the table. The `row` object and `isRowCollapsed` state are passed as arguments to this fn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `isTruncated`          | `boolean` | -        | `false` | Set this to `true` to allow text content of this cell to be truncated with an ellipsis, instead of breaking into multiple lines. Read the note about this option below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `isSortable`           | `boolean` | -        | `false` | If this is `true`, this column's header will be a become a button which calls `onSortChange` when clicked. You should enable this flag for every column you want to be able to sort. When at least one column is sortable, the table props `sortBy`, `sortDirection` and `onSortChange` should be set.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `disableResizing`      | `boolean` | -        | `false` | Set this to `true` to prevent this column from being manually resized by dragging the edge of the header with a mouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `shouldIgnoreRowClick` | `boolean` | -        | `false` | Set this to `true` to prevent click event propagation for this cell. You might want this if you need the column to have its own call-to-action or input while the row also has a defined `onRowClick`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `headerIcon`           | `node`    | -        | -       | Use this prop to place an `Icon` or `IconButton` on the left of the column label. It is advised to place these types of components through this prop instead of `label` in order to become properly positioned and aligned. This is particularly useful for medium-sized icons which require more vertical space than the typography.                                                                                                                                 |

> Note about `isTruncated`: When using this option, it is recommended to specify a `width` for the column, because if the table doesn't have enough space for all columns, it will start clipping the columns with _truncated_ content, and if no `width` is set (or the value is set `auto` -- the default) it can shrink until the column disappears completely. By enforcing a minimum width for these columns, the table will respect them and grow horizontally, adding scrollbars if needed.
