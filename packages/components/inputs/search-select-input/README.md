The underlying `@commercetools-uikit/async-select-input` is built on top of [`react-select`](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) v3. `@commercetools-uikit/async-select-input` supports mostly the same properties as `react-select` with some minor changes in the behaviour of some of the props. The `@commercetools-uikit/search-select-input` which is built on top `@commercetools-uikit/async-select-input` has predefined values for some the props. The props that have predefined values in `@commercetools-uikit/search-select-input` are as follows:

- `components.DropdownIndicator`: Default dropdown indicator is replaced with search icon indicator
- `components.Option`: The option shown in the dropdown menu can be one of `singled-lined`, `brief-detailed`, or `extended-detailed` types. However, if someone still wants to have a different option layout, they can still pass their own `components.Option` to `@commercetools-uikit/search-select-input`
- `isSearchable`: `true`
- `iconLeft`: `undefined`

See the [official documentation](https://react-select.com/components) for more information about the available props.
