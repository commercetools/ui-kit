## Signatures

### Signature `onBlur`

```

### Signature `onChange`

```ts
(event: TCustomEvent, info: ActionMeta<unknown>) => void
```

This input is built on top of [`react-select`](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) v2.
It supports mostly same properties as `react-select`. Behavior for some props was changed, and support for others was dropped.

In case you need one of the currently excluded props, feel free to open a PR adding them.

### Static Properties

#### `isTouched(touched)`

Returns truthy value for the Formik `touched` value of this input field.

- `ClearIndicator`
- `Control`
- `CrossIcon`
- `DownChevron`
- `DropdownIndicator`
- `Group`
- `GroupHeading`
- `IndicatorsContainer`
- `IndicatorSeparator`

- `MultiValueContainer`
- `MultiValueLabel`
- `MultiValueRemove`
- `NoOptionsMessage`
- `Option`
- `Placeholder`
- `SelectContainer`

- `ValueContainer`

See the [official documentation](https://react-select.com/components) for more information about the props they receive.
