This component should be used whenever you need to display a floating panel after clicking on an element.

It allows to use any component as the element used to trigger the floating panel.

The panel can be customized to render whatever is needed. However, as a common use case would be to render a list of elements and select one of them, this component provides some helpers to easily implement such use case.

Something to bear in mind is that, when the panel is open, the document scroll is blocked.
