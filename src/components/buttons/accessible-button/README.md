# AccessibleButton

A React component that you can use to wrap your buttons in an accessibile
`<button/>` element.

## How to use it?

The `AccessibleButton` component is intended to be used as a wrapper for your
actual button component.

```jsx
const Button = props => (
  <AccessibleButton
    label={props.label}
    onClick={props.onClick}
    isToggled={props.isToggled}
    isDisabled={props.isDisabled}
    className={styles.button}
  >
    <div className={styles.default}>
      {Boolean(props.iconLeft) && props.iconLeft}
      <span>{props.label}</span>
    </div>
  </AccessibleButton>
);
Button.propTypes = {
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  iconLeft: PropTypes.node,
  /* set to true or false to indicate a toggle button */
  isToggled: PropTypes.bool,
  isDisabled: PropTypes.bool,
  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

Button.displayName = 'Button';

export default Button;
```

| buttonAttributes | Object   |     -     | Attributes to be applied to the `<button/>` element. Can be use to e.g. add data-\* attributes to the button. |

## How does it work?

### Using a `<button/>`

> If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and

This means that instead of using a `<div/>` to create a button we should use the
`<button/>` element.

The problem with using the `<button/>` element for creating a button is that in
[some browsers the `<button/>` element cannot be used as a flex
container](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs#9-some-html-elements-cant-be-flex-containers).

To solve both problems at once we need to nest a `<div/>` inside the
`<button/>`. This `<div/>` contains the actual button content, like the label
and/or an icon.

### Toggle buttons

In order to indicate to screenreaders that a button is a toggle button â€” meaning
that it will keep the active state once clicked â€” you need to set the
`aria-pressed` attribute accordingly.

This is automatically done when you specify the `isToggled` property. If this
prop is omitted though we don't set the `aria-pressed` attribute at all so
screenreaders to not mistake our button for a togglable button.

### Icon buttons

In order for screenreaders to know what a button does we need to provide a
proper label. The `<button/>` element is able to figure out the `aria-label` on
its own for simple buttons that only contain text.

For buttons that contain an icon however the default `aria-label` would also
contain the icon, which probably our screenreader does not know how to read out
ðŸ˜‰.

So we need to manually set the `aria-label` attribute. You need to do so by
providing the `label` prop.

### Disabled buttons

In order for screenreaders to know if your button is disabled we need to set the
`aria-disabled` and `disabled` attributes on the button. We do so automatically
if you set the `isDisabled` prop to true.
