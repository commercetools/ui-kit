Install full ICU data

###

to use:

    npm install full-icu

or for global install:

    npm install -g full-icu

Instructions will be printed out on how to activate this data for your version of node.

The work gets done in a `postinstall` script which copies the `icudt*.dat` file
up to this module's level.

# API

`require('full-icu')` returns a few properties:

- `nodever` - the full Node version (ex: `4.2.0`)

- `node_maj` - the major part of the node version (ex: `4`)

- `node_min` - the minor part of the node version (ex `2`)

- `icu_small` - if truthy, means that node was built with
  small-icu (English only). If falsy, means that the `full-icu`
  package is not relevant.

- `icuver` - full ICU version, if available, such as 55.1. Sometimes only the major
  version is available.

- `icumaj` - ICU major ver, such as `55`. May be === `icuver`.

- `icumin` - ICU minor version, such as `1` if available.

- `icuend` - ICU endianness - *l*ittle, *b*ig or *e*bcdic.

- `icupkg` - the `npm` package needed to get full ICU data, if any.

- `icudat` - the raw data file ICU expects to find for full data, if any.

- `noi18n` - if truthy, no ICU / Intl build was enabled for your node version. Sorry.

- `oldNode` - Node is older (`<0.12`) than this package can really think about.

# BIN

`node-full-icu-path` will print the full `icudt*.dat` path, if available.
